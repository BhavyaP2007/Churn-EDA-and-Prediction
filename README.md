Visualized trends using matplotlib.

ü§ñ Modeling
Model: RandomForestClassifier
Preprocessing: OneHotEncoding with ColumnTransformer, handling NaNs, reshaping labels
Evaluation: Accuracy score on train-test split
Future: Add XGBoost, feature importance, and clustering

Requirements
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
xgboost
